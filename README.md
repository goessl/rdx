# rdx

A radix conversion module.

## Installation

```
pip install rdx
```

## Usage

This module provides the following functions:
- `to_digits(n, b=10)` to convert a number into a digit representation,
- `from_digits(d, b=10)` to retrieve a number from a digit representation and
- `len_digits(n, b=10)` to calculate how many digits will be needed.
```python
>>> from rdx import *
>>> to_digits(42, 2)
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
>>> to_digits(42, 16)
[10, 2]
>>> from_digits([27, 1], 42)
69
>>> len_digits(1024, 2)
11
```
As a digit representation a list with integers is used, where every element
represents a digit, all ordered in ascending positions.
